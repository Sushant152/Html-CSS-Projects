AI ToDo List - Code Improvements & Industry Standards

1. **Folder Structure & Naming**
   - Created new folder `8-AI Todo List-Code` for improved codebase.
   - Used clear, consistent file names: `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`.

2. **HTML Improvements**
   - Improved semantic structure and accessibility (e.g., button IDs, alt text).
   - Removed inline event handlers; all JS is now in `app.js`.
   - Used modern meta tags and responsive design.

3. **CSS Improvements**
   - Used CSS variables for theme colors and easy customization.
   - Improved accessibility, contrast, and responsive units.
   - Reduced specificity, improved maintainability, and modernized styles.
   - Added transitions and hover effects for better UX.

4. **JavaScript Improvements**
   - Modular, event-driven code using `DOMContentLoaded` for safe DOM access.
   - Used `const`/`let` and arrow functions for modern JS.
   - Improved localStorage usage with clear separation for tasks and logs.
   - Used ISO date format and `toLocaleString()` for better date display.
   - Improved log history table rendering and task completion tracking.
   - Used event delegation for task actions (complete/delete).
   - Removed unnecessary global variables and improved function naming.
   - Used setInterval for periodic cleanup (removes completed tasks after 10 min).
   - All UI logic is in JS, no inline HTML event attributes.

5. **Accessibility & UX**
   - Added ARIA roles and alt text for images.
   - Improved button focus and hover states.
   - Provided user feedback for empty log/history.
   - Used confirm dialogs for destructive actions.

6. **Performance & Maintainability**
   - Reduced DOM queries, improved event handling.
   - All code is modular and easy to extend (e.g., for AI features).
   - CSS and JS are separated for clarity.

7. **Ready for AI Integration**
   - Code structure allows easy addition of AI features (e.g., smart suggestions, NLP).
